Welcome to my new website! I'm excited to share this space with you, built using the powerful static site generator [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and deployed seamlessly on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Why I Chose Eleventy

After exploring various static site generators, I settled on Eleventy for several compelling reasons:

- **Flexibility**: Eleventy doesn't impose a specific template language or framework
- **Performance**: Static sites are incredibly fast and secure
- **Developer Experience**: Great tooling and documentation
- **Simplicity**: Clean, understandable build process

## What You Can Expect

This site will serve as a platform for sharing:

### Technical Content
- Web development tutorials and tips
- Code snippets and solutions
- Technology reviews and comparisons

### Personal Projects
- Open source contributions
- Side projects and experiments
- Learning experiences and insights

### Industry Thoughts
- Trends in web development
- Best practices and methodologies
- Tool recommendations

## The Technology Stack

This site is built with modern web technologies:

```javascript
// Example of how simple Eleventy configuration can be
module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {
  eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy("src/assets");
  
  return {
    dir: {
      input: "src",
      output: "_site"
    }
  };
};
```

- **Static Site Generator**: Eleventy
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with modern features
- **Hosting**: Netlify with automatic deployments
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub integration

## Getting Started

If you're interested in building something similar, here's how you can get started:

1. **Install Eleventy**: `npm install -g @11ty/eleventy`
2. **Create your project**: Set up your directory structure
3. **Add content**: Write your pages in Markdown or HTML
4. **Deploy**: Push to GitHub and connect to Netlify

> The best way to learn is by doing. Don't be afraid to experiment and make mistakes along the way!

## What's Next?

I'm planning to regularly update this site with new content. Some upcoming topics include:

- Deep dive into Eleventy's templating system
- Building responsive layouts without frameworks
- Optimizing static sites for performance
- Integrating third-party services

## Stay Connected

I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to [get in touch](/contact/) if you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to say hello.

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find the content here helpful and inspiring!
